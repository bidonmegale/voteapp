Vote Tiny Application
=====================

This simple vote application demonstrates the difference between the most popular implementations like: jQuery, Ember, Angular, React and Marionette.

You can run the index.html file directly on the browser to test each implementation.

Except Angular version that doesn't uses ES6 syntax, all others use ES6 syntax through Babel in-browser transformation.

Thanks Babel to allow us to use ES6 syntax directly from the browser to test new features in Ecmascript/2015.

My intention is not compare the better solution/framework, but only demonstrate how you can implement the same application using different approaches.

Thanks.
